    "# Candy Crush in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will create a candy crush style game from scratch using python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The game consists of a grid of tiles, each tile containing one of five different gem stones. The player must try to get three or more of the same gem stone in a row, either horizontally or vertically. The played does this by clicking two neighbouring tiles to swap them. If a swap results in three or more tiles in a horizontal or vertical row all of the tiles in that row are removed, otherwise the tiles are swapped back. After the tiles have been removed, the tiles above drop down to fill the space, and new tiles are added in to fill any remaining spaces at the top.\n",

    "* How to create an object and call a function on \n",
    "* Writing loops and using the range function\n",

    "The project uses two libraries, numpy and gamegrid. Its possible that you will have the numpy library installed already in jupyter, but if not simply run `pip install numpy` on the machine running jupyter - or you can do it directly in jupyter by running the command below:"
