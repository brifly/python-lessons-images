    "This is a tutorial series designed to give an introduction to programming using the python language. It starts with lessons on the basic concepts of python programming and then works through building a simple game using python. At the end of this you should be comfortable with writing basic programs using python. \n",

    "## Lessons\n",

    "There are three more lessons that cover some of the basics:\n",

    "* [Types, Expressions and Variables](TypesExpressionsAndVars.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Control Flow](ControlFlow.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Functions](Functions.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the material for this tutorial is in the project lessons. The lessons above cover all the basics needed to start the project - the project uses all of the material covered in these and you should have a good understanding before proceeding. When you have completed you can continue on to:\n",

To use or 'call' the `print` function we need to put some round brackets after it `(` and `)`. We put whatever we want to print out in between those brackets `print(...)` - whatever we put in place of the `...` is what we want to print out.\n",
